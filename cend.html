   <b>
    <p> 2018, SF.  Digital re-design and product video roduced for Bain & Company.


<p><b><i>Small changes with big results.</i><b></p>

<p><i>Cend</i> is a global E-wallet that lets you easily deposit and send money to anyone anywhere in the world.<br>
Cend wanted to boost their profitability, and increase market share. By parterning with the Bain team, made up of consultants and designers,
Cend was able to achieve much larger user-retention in onboarding and sign-up, allowing for thier customer base to grow.</p>
<p>
As part of the ADAPT (Advanced Digital and Product Team) group, my role in the project was to re-brand the product so it could be shown to potential clients.
In addition ot this digital re-design, I also led development of a 'product story' video. This included storyboarding, scriptwriting, direction, editing,
and animation. The final video continues to be shown throughout the company as a success story, not only for the product, but as a new way to tell 
stories at Bain.
</p>

<p><i>All media below is footage from the final video. All product screens and animations designed by me.</i></p>

<h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
</div>

<div class="artwork fade-in-element">


<p> Cend's original sign-up process was lengthy, requiring nearly 5 steps and more than 18 fields.</p>
<p> The case team and designers looked to reduce friction during this onbaording process after studying each interaction in this process.<br>
<p>This exploration was later illustrated in qire-frame anmations I produced for the film.</p>

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p> By protoyping, user-testing, and overall following design principles that were human-centred, ADAPT and Bain tested and iterated
until a reduced and effective sign-up process was produced.</p>

<p> The final sign-up process was reduced down to a single page.</p>

<h3>Video Design</h3>

<p> Alongside storyboarding and writing the script, I edited and animated the sequences shown in the film.</p>
<p> Taking inspiration by famous Apple product launch films, I was careful to consider that the objective of this video was not jus toillustrate the product
, as many of the previous films for Bain had been, but to tell the entire process story. By creating wireframes that grew and evolved,
I illustrated iteration and change without pulling too far on charts and data.</p>

<p> Further beauty shots enhanced the overall immersion of the film and placed the product in the real world, or less 'protoype-y' settings.</p>
