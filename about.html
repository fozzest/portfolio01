<div class="about">
<p >I am currently a junior studying Design and Technology with a minor in Immersive Storytelling at Parsons School of Design, in NYC. I am fascinated with exploring technologies, materials, and constructs such as time and space. My work spans many mediums, with a current focus on the intersection between biology and technology as a way of revealing unique and meaningful  experiences.  
</P>
<p>
 

I cherish the sensations that come from a sense of place and nostalgia,  but am motivated by finding new approaches to using design as a way to connect with ourselves, others, and the environment around us.
