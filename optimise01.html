<p><b><i>Imagine quick and accurate recommendations and alterations to make your pics POP on social media. Gather followers, impress your sponsors, and be the best version of yourself.</i><b></p>

<p><i>Optimise</i> is a service that uses Quantum computer servers and mobile interfaces to offer reliable, accurate, and fast image processing and adjustments to make sure your social
media stays cohesive and contemporary. By providing a range of Optimisations, as well as being able to pull qualities from popular iamges to your own pictures, Optimise dynamically alters your imagery to its greatest potential.
Using Quantum computation and quantum neural nets from our own quantum computers, Optimise is able to assist classical machine learning and image processing through new quantum alogrithms that behave similarly to the
Generative Advaserial Networks popularised in the late 2010s. Building off of this, Optimise leverages Quantum Computing's ability to move through big data, meaning Optimise takes the best of the best of social media,
and gives it to you.</p>

<h3>Case Study</h3>

<p>Optimise can be setup in preferences to suit desires of needs. In this case study, we look at Sam, a 23 year old Instagram influencer looking to expand his demographic, 
impress his sponsors, and overall offer a more cohesive aesthetic to his followers. Sam is a creative, and wants to feel like the pictures are his,
but is open to exploring new ways of expression and gaining more influence. Always on the move, Sam can't afford to have his own Quantum Computer editing suite
or spend too much time studying emerging trends on Instagram, but he wants to stay current in an era of professional social media.</p>
